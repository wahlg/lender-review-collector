       "content":"Cassie N. was great and very prompt in her communications with us. My husband and I wanted to refinance some credit card debt and First Midwest Bank came through for us. We weren't approved at first but when I provided more detailed income information we were quickly approved and received the money quickly. As per the loan agreement, the bank sent checks directly to a couple of creditors to ensure they were paid off and the checks arrived in less than a week. It feels really good to be able to continue on my plan to be completely debt free in 3 years! Thanks FMB \u0026 Cassie!",
